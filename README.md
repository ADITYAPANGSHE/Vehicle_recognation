# Vehicle Detection using MobileNet SSD

This project implements a real-time vehicle detection system using the **MobileNet SSD** model, which can identify various vehicles like cars, buses, trains, motorbikes, bicycles, and aeroplanes.

## Features

- Real-time detection of vehicles using a webcam or video input.
- Detects a variety of vehicles, including **car**, **bus**, **train**, **motorbike**, **aeroplane**, and **bicycle**.
- Built using **OpenCV** and the **MobileNet SSD** model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone 
```
2. Place the model files in the project directory.

## How to Use

1. Open the project folder.
2. Run the following command to start vehicle detection:

```bash
python vehicle_detection.py
```

3. The program will use your webcam (or a video file if specified) to perform real-time vehicle detection.

4. You can press `q` to exit the detection window.

## Example Output

The system will show a live stream with bounding boxes drawn around detected vehicles, displaying their type (car, bus, train, motorbike, etc.) and confidence score.
